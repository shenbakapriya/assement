* The assignment should be completed in around 4 hours
  *  if you are running out of time, please add comments in README file where you can describe the steps that you were planning to do in order to complete the assignment.
  
* The application should be implemented with angular 10 and bootstrap framework

* The components created should be covered with simple unit tests

* The backend calls should be real http calls using a mock to simulate the real backend operations.
  * Once the backend is ready, it should be just one line to replace the mock.

* Documentation of the implemented functionality and instructions how to build and run are present (README file).

* Do this assignment on your own

* Do not disclose any detail of this assignment

## Assignment

The goal is to implement an application which represents a basic project management flow.

It should store all records in the browser local storage and perform real backend API calls.


* Home page shows the list of projects
  * Each project in the list should have an "Archive" button next to it.
    * On click, a modal should be popped up asking "Are you sure that you want to archive ```project name```?"
      * If the answer is yes, the project should be archived and removed from the project list.
  * In the top right corner there should be a "Create" button.
    * When the user clicks on it, it should display a form on new page/path.
      * Fields:
        * name - String 100 
        * status - One of *IN_PROGRESS* or *FINISHED*
      * Save button
        * On click, the new project should be added to project list and user should be navigated back to project list


## Backend

Those are the details of the backend (to be mocked)

**Project** model where status can be *IN_PROGRESS* or *FINISHED*.


```
Long id;
String name;
StatusEnum status;
LocalDateTime dateCreated;
boolean archived;
```
